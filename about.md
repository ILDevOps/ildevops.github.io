IL DevOps is a community user group for gathering to share knowledge around technologies and processes.

AnsibleCU was co-founded as a local Ansible Meetup by Joanna Delaporte in 2014 with Edward Delaporte (#edthedev) and Greg DeKoenigsberg (#gregdek). During the Covid-19 pandemic, the meetup switched to an online format and was renamed to AnsibleIL for a broader geographical audience, and more recently to ILDevOps to meet a broader technical audience.
